When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories are useful for allowing for collaboration among multiple people who are also able to work offline.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If pulls were done automatically then unexpected changes could be introduced that the code is not yet ready for.
