When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories are useful for allowing for collaboration among multiple people who are also able to work offline.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If pulls were done automatically then unexpected changes could be introduced that the code is not yet ready for.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy of a repository that you add to your own account. A clone is just a copy of any repository. A branch is a set of commits within a single repository. Forks are used when you don't have permission to modify a given repository. Cloning is used to make a copy of a repository on a local machine. Branches are used to develop features or test something without affecting the main or master version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This allows you to be able to track any changes that have happened on the local copy of the repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Less technical steps and knowledge would be required but tracking all changes would need to be done manually and roling back to a previous known state would at times be impossible.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Making changes directly in Master simplifies the workflow but also directly chages the current working version. Using a sepparate branch allows for independent testing and development that does not effect the Master branch until it is completed, reviewed and merged.
